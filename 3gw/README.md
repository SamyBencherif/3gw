# 3gw

Welcome to 3d Game Worlds.

3gw is a project by Samie Bee (aka Samy Bencherif) based on a workshop at UNC Chapel Hill for HackNC. The purpose is to provide a convenient starting point for first-person 3D games.

## dependencies

Dependencies are pieces of software written by other people. For instance I am using THREE.js for rendering. Dependencies are located in the `ext` folder, which is short for "external".
